    <h2>OlÃ¡ ðŸ‘‹ (it means hello in Portuguese) and nice to meet you.</h2>
    <p class="main-p">My name is Bruna Marcela and nowadays, I'm a Product Designer. I was born and raised in Viana do Castelo â€” a small and beautiful city from the north of Portugal. </p>
    <p class="main-p">I've always seen myself as a creative person as well as a thinker. And this characteristics led me to have interest in Analog Photography and Cinema â€” I've made a <a href="https://youtu.be/FNuijf5blt8" target="_blank" title="See the Documentary Film made by Bruna Marcela">documentary film</a>, take a look.</p>

    <h3>How did it all start?</h3>
    <p class="main-p">The beginning was an adventure, I had to go all the way from the north of Portugal to Lisbon, the capital. And why? To do my bachelor's degree in Communication Design, in 2017. When I graduated, I've started to work.</p>
