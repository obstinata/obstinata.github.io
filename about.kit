                <p>My name is Bruna Marcela and nowadays, I'm a Product Designer.</p>
                <p>I've always seen myself as a creative person as well as a thinker. And this
                    characteristics led me to have interest in Analog Photography. I enjoy to stop time by taking
                    pictures and collecting memories for a lifetime. </p>
                <p>And also to have interest in Cinema, in this field I had the opportunity to produce a <a class="normal-link"

                        title="Check my documentary film.">documentary film</a>, take a look.</p>

                <h3>Ok, but... ðŸ¤” <br> How did I end up as a Product Designer?</h3>

            <div class="paragraph-about">
                <p>I felt a little bit stuck and I was thirsty for a new experience. I wanted to change the world!
                    My wish was to solve real problems, to help people.</p>
                <p>And Product Design was the perfect field. Here I can develop meaningful
                    and thoughtful user-centered experiences, that improve people's lives. </p>
                <p>I have a passion for solving problems and I also love to find the best of the best solutions by
                    designing great experiences for users with a strategic mindset in order to offer a pleased
                    usability.</p>
